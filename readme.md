Created a Natour project using Node.js, mastering MongoDB, Express error handling, and authentication. Ensured data security, explored Advanced Mongoose, and implemented server-side rendering with Pug templates. Added advanced features like payments, email, and file uploads for a dynamic web app. Learned a lot, excited for more!
